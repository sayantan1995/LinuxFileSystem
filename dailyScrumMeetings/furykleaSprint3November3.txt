a) What did I work on last time? 
	- Worked on redesigning our project based on
	TA's comments
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Finish writing the test cases.
	- Add in the javadoc to the files.
	- Fix the directory class.

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	- I'm a little blocked on how directory is a
	parent of file. But, we're meeting as a group
	tomorrow so we should be able to figure it out
	then.
