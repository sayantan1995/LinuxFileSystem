a) What did I work on last time? 
	- Wrote the code for the Manual class.
	- Started work on the directory, change directory and new directory class.
	- Wrote the CRC cards for CommandParser and PathParser. 
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Finish coding directory, change directory and new directory class.
	- Work on incorporating polymorphism into the design.
	- Write the code so that JShell can call the Manual class.

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	-Currently, I am blocked on how to write the directory class. I'm not using a constructor which could
	be causing problems. I'm also blocked on how to make make directory and class directory
	work together.
