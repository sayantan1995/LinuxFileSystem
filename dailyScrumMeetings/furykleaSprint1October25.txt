a) What did I work on last time? 
	- Completion of CRC Card for Directory Class
	- Wrote code for Directory Class (rough implementation
	idea of using a stack to store the directory names)
	- Completion of the command manual, but not added to the
	file yet. As, I think it would be easier to add when the
	writing of the class for the mannual command. 
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Sprint 2, starts tomorrow so that will be what I am 
	working on.
	- Research on Lab 6, so that I can better understand how to
	improve the design of our project.
	- Completion of the rest of the CRC Cards.

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	-Currently, I am not blocked on anything
